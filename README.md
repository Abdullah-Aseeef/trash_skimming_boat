# 🧹 Trash Skimming Robot for Water Bodies

This repository contains code, models, and evaluation workflows for a trash detection system aimed at identifying floating waste in water bodies. The system uses the YOLO object detection architecture and is designed for integration with an autonomous trash-skimming robot.

## 🧠 Project Objective

To detect and classify floating trash in water bodies using YOLO-based object detection. The aim is to support real-time deployment on edge devices (e.g., Jetson Nano) for robotic waste removal applications.

---

## 🏗️ Methodology

### Baseline

* **Model:** YOLOv12 (custom trained on water-trash dataset)
* **Data:** 3,798 annotated images, Pascal VOC format, 19 overlapping trash classes
* **Metrics:** Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F1 Score

### Improvements

* Refined trash label set for better consistency
* IoU-based evaluation to distinguish overlapping and missed detections
* Video annotation pipeline for real-world frame-by-frame assessment

---

## 🎯 Results Summary

| Metric    | Baseline YOLO |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Accuracy  | 30.4%         |
| Precision | 57.6%         |
| Recall    | 39.1%         |
| F1 Score  | 46.6%         |

### Challenges Identified

* Poor detection of small or reflective objects
* False positives on background elements and water reflections
* Inconsistencies due to lighting, weather, and camera angle

---

## 🖼️ Visualizations

* **Bounding Boxes:** Red = Ground Truth, Green = Predicted
* **Annotated Videos:** Found in `results/annotated_videos/*`

---

## 📹 Video Annotation Pipeline

1. Load video frame-by-frame with OpenCV
2. Perform inference using YOLO
3. Draw bounding boxes around trash detections
4. Save annotated frames into output video
